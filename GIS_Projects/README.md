# 🗺️ GIS and Spatial Analysis Projects

This section highlights my GIS work focusing on disaster risk assessment, mapping, and visualization using QGIS, ArcGIS, and Google Earth Engine.

## 🌋 Projects
| Project | Description | Tools |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Machakos Flood Risk Map** | Created a hazard map identifying flood-prone zones. | QGIS, DEM Data |
| **Landslide Susceptibility Study** | Mapped high-risk slope areas using satellite data. | Google Earth Engine |
| **Community Infrastructure Mapping** | Digitized schools, health centers, and water points for disaster response planning. | OSM, ArcGIS |

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
