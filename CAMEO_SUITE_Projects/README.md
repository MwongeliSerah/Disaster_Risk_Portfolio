# CAMEO Suite Projects
These projects demonstrate my ability to model chemical hazards using the CAMEO software suite (ALOHA, MARPLOT, CAMEO Data Manager) for chemical hazard modeling, emergency planning, and environmental risk analysis. They include real-world simulations for spill scenarios, vulnerability zones, and evacuation planning.

## üî¨ Sample Projects
- **Ammonia Gas Release Simulation:** Modeled the dispersion of an ammonia leak using ALOHA and mapped vulnerability zones in MARPLOT.
- **Evacuation Planning Scenario:** Simulated chemical spill impacts to design safe evacuation routes and shelter points.
- **Industrial Hazard Database:** Managed chemical inventory and hazard data with CAMEO Data Manager.

## üß∞ Tools & Skills
- ALOHA (Air dispersion modeling)
- MARPLOT (Mapping and visualization)
- CAMEO Data Manager (Chemical information system)
- Basic emergency response planning
