# ðŸš¨ Disaster Response Coordination

This section illustrates the structure, planning, and coordination mechanisms involved in disaster response operations.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- To outline coordination workflows between agencies.
- To define response roles and communication flow.
- To demonstrate understanding of Incident Command Systems (ICS).

---

## ðŸ§© Example Scenario
Simulated **flash floods in Makueni County** leading to the activation of the county-level Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

### Key Actions:
1. KRCS branch alerts NDOC via hotline.
2. County ICS activated â€” Operations, Logistics, and Planning sections established.
3. Rapid needs assessment deployed using Kobo forms.
4. Response timeline tracked for accountability and review.

## ðŸ§  Tools
- **CAMEO & MARPLOT:** For hazard scenario modeling.  
- **KoboToolbox:** For real-time needs assessment.  
- **Excel/Power BI:** For tracking response metrics.

## ðŸ§¾ Lessons Learned
Strong coordination and predefined roles reduce response time and duplication of effort.  
This structure can be adapted for any hazard type at county or sub-county level.
