# 🌍 Mwongeli Serah — Disaster Risk Analyst Portfolio

Welcome! This repository documents my professional journey in **Disaster Risk Management**, **Monitoring & Evaluation**, **GIS**, and **Data Analysis**.

## 🌍 Disaster Risk Management Skills & Tools

My background combines disaster analysis, monitoring & evaluation, and geospatial tools for risk-informed decision making.

### Risk and Planning Frameworks
- **DesInventar Sendai:** Experience in disaster loss data management and trend analysis.
- **Contingency Planning:** Development of multi-hazard response plans integrating institutional and community capacities.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Designing and conducting community and environmental vulnerability assessments.
- **Incident Command System (ICS):** Knowledge in structuring coordinated emergency response operations.

### Analytical and Technical Tools
- **CAMEO Suite (ALOHA, MARPLOT, Data Manager)** – chemical hazard modeling and risk mapping  
- **GIS (QGIS, ArcGIS)** – spatial hazard and vulnerability analysis  
- **KoboToolbox, Power BI, Excel** – data collection and visualization  
- **Python, SQL** – data analysis and reporting automation  

### Application
I apply these skills to bridge technical risk analysis and policy-level disaster preparedness, especially within humanitarian contexts.


## 📂 Project Areas
- **Monitoring and Evaluation** — field data collection, dashboards, and impact reports.
- **GIS Projects** — spatial analysis and risk mapping using QGIS & Google Earth Engine.
- **Data Analysis** — Python, Excel, and Power BI work on humanitarian datasets.
- **Drone and Remote Sensing** — exploring drone imagery for disaster assessment.

## 🧠 Current Focus
Building a data-driven approach to disaster risk analysis and early warning systems for Kenya and East Africa.
